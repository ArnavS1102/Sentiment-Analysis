# Sentiment-Analysis
This is an on-going project. Will fully update this repository once the project is complete.
The lstm_sentiment is the neural network that I built to determine whether the sentiment of a sentence is positive or negative. This is a recurrent neural network(RNN) which uses Long Short-Term Memory. The model has an embedding layer as well that uses Stanford's GloVe pre trained embedding weights.
